                      General Learner Outcomes (GLO's)


      General Learner Outcomes are the essential overarching goals for all
grade levels, from elementary through middle to high, and all of the
academic disciplines, whether mathematics, career and life skills, health,
or any of the seven other content areas. Every content standard and every
benchmark and grade level performance indicator should support the
learner’s progress towards these outcomes because they enable learners to
lead full and productive lives.


These General Learner Outcomes do not exist in isolation, but should be an
integral part of the school culture as demonstrated in daily classroom
instruction and assessment. They are:


   •  Self-directed Learner (The ability to be responsible for one’s own
      learning)


   •  Community Contributor (The understanding that it is essential for
      human beings to work together)


   •  Complex Thinker (The ability to demonstrate critical thinking and
      problem solving)


   •  Quality Producer (The ability to recognize and produce quality
      performance and quality products)


   •  Effective Communicator (The ability to communicate effectively)


   •  Effective and Ethical User of Technology (The ability to use a variety
      of technologies effectively and ethically)
